-- Test Data Validation: Checking if records exist in both source and target tables

-- Source table: orders_source
SELECT COUNT(*) AS source_record_count
FROM orders_source;

-- Target table after ETL process: orders_target
SELECT COUNT(*) AS target_record_count
FROM orders_target;

-- Validation: Check if records are identical after transformation
