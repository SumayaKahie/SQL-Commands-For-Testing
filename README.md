# SQL Practice Repository - by Sumaya

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository is dedicated to build on and hone SQL skills. The goal is to build a strong foundation in SQL queries, specifically focusing on areas such as **data validation**, **ETL pipelines**, **complex joins**, and **testing scenarios**.

## Key Areas Covered:
- **Data Validation**: Queries that help compare source and target data, ensuring accuracy during the ETL process.
- **ETL Testing**: Creating and validating SQL queries that simulate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data.
- **Complex Joins**: Mastering different join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) to work with multiple tables effectively.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()` for data analysis and validation.
- **Data Transformation**: Implementing SQL `CASE` statements for data classification during transformations.

## Why This Repository Exists:
This project was created to practice the skills mentioned in the **job description for a Junior Data Test Engineer** role at Clarion. These skills include:
- Testing data validation scenarios
- Understanding ETL and ELT processes
- Using SQL to validate transformed data
- Working with cloud-based data tools and testing practices (Azure, Power BI, etc.)

The repository is designed to simulate real-world data validation and transformation tasks that are common in data-driven companies.

## Technologies Used:
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **Power BI** (For data reporting and validation)
- **ETL/ELT** concepts and processes
- **SQL Joins, Aggregation, and Grouping Functions**
